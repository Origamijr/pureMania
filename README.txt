This is a project I made for a Computer Music course. 

There is only one Pd file, pureMania.pd. I decided to use local subpatches instead of abstractions to avoid having an overflow of files for a temporary project. All other files should be in the same directory as this Pd file.

There is an additional folder called pianoSamples not being included in this repository. pianoSamples is a very large folder because it contains long piano samples for 3 keys. It totals to 177MB. Audacity was acting up on me, so I couldn't get the time to cut the file size down. Sorry. The files can be downloaded here: http://theremin.music.uiowa.edu/MISpiano.html

All the other txt files contain timestamped data for a qlist read inside of pureMania.pd. While file reading generally does work, map.txt and map2.txt are far to complex for my system to handle. I might show them in the presentation, but I probably won't actually interact with them.
